EXERCISE 1
	104.18.60.21
	104.18.61.21
	172.67.219.46
	Having multiple IP addresses means the website can handle high traffic.

EXERCISE 2	
	HOST					REACHABLE	NOTES
	www.unsw.edu.au			YES
	www.getfittest.com.au	NO			Not a valid web address
	www.mit.edu				YES
	www.intel.com.au		YES
	www.tpg.com.au			YES
	www.hola.hp				NO			.hp isn't a valid domain suffix
	www.amazon.com			YES
	www.tsinghua.edu.cn		YES
	www.kremlin.ru			NO			The kremlin site might have increased security on the site to avoid cyber attacks as it is a government website
	8.8.8.8					YES

EXERCISE 3
	1.	Columbia Trace: columbiaTraceroute.txt
	
		Number of routers: 22
		Number on UNSW network: 5
		Crosses pacfic ocean: between 7 and 9. Router 8 is in Hawaii (IP address: 113.197.15.99)

	2.	UCLA Trace: uclaTraceroute.txt
		Tokyo Trace: tokyoTraceroute.txt
		Lancaster Trace: lancasterTraceroute.txt

		The routes diverge after router 3 which is within the UNSW network. However they rejoin at the aarnet router (IP address: 138.44.5.0) which is located in Kensington. 

	3.	i)	Singapore to UNSW Trace: sinToUnswTraceroute.txt
			UNSW to Singapore Trace: unswToSinTraceroute.txt

			IP Address for Singapore: 202.150.221.170
		
		ii)	Telstra to UNSW Trace: telstraToUnswTraceroute.txt
			UNSW to Telstra: unswToTelstraTraceroute.txt

			IP Address for Telstra: 203.50.5.178

		Yes, there are common routers in the forward and reverse routes in both traces however the same IP addresses are not observed. 			This is likely due to the fact there are dedicated input and output interfaces in the routers to deal with incoming and outgoing traces.

EXERCISE 4

	1.	Distance to Brisbane: 913km, Time: 0.00304s
		Distance to Manilla: 6270km, Time: 0.0209s
		Distance to Berlin: 16090km, Time: 0.5363s

	2.	No the delays are not constant because there can be queueing in the various routers used, resulting in delays that may not occur at other times. 

	3.	Not in Switzerland.

	4.	Processing and transmission delays depend on packet size while queueing and propogation delays do not.
